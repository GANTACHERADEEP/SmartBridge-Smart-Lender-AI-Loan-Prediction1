## 📌 Project Overview

Smart Lender is a Machine Learning-powered web application that predicts whether a loan application should be **Approved** or **Rejected** based on applicant information.

The application helps financial institutions make faster, consistent, and data-driven lending decisions by using machine learning algorithms trained on historical loan application data.

The trained model is deployed using **Flask**, allowing users to submit loan details through a web interface and receive real-time predictions.
